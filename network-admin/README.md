# Network Administration Project

## Overview
This project focuses on **network reconnaissance and documentation** within a controlled lab environment. Using **Nmap** for network scanning and **Wireshark** for packet analysis, the goal was to **identify active devices, assess open ports, and analyze running services** to gain a comprehensive understanding of the network topology.

## Key Objectives
- Conduct **network-wide scans** to map active devices and gather system details.
- Utilize **Nmap** to perform in-depth **TCP and UDP scans** for service enumeration.
- Capture and analyze network traffic using **Wireshark** to validate findings.
- Create structured **network documentation**, including a **topology diagram** and security recommendations.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Nmap** – Network scanning, OS detection, and service enumeration.
- **Wireshark** – Packet capture and traffic analysis.
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)** – Windows, Linux, and Kali OpenVAS instances for testing.
- **Zenmap** – GUI-based visualization of scan results. 

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Network Scanning & Information Collection
- **Executed Nmap scans** to detect **IP addresses, MAC addresses, open ports, and running services**.
- **Captured traffic using Wireshark** to confirm scan results and analyze communication patterns.
- **Verified findings** by cross-checking discovered information with device configurations.

### 2. Documentation & Report
- Compiled findings into a **detailed report**, including:
  - **Device inventory** with key attributes (hostname, OS, open ports).
  - **Traffic analysis screenshots** from Wireshark with explanations.
  - **Topology diagram** illustrating network segmentation and security recommendations.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Network mapping & documentation** – Structured identification and reporting of network assets.
- **Traffic analysis** – Recognizing packet flow patterns and identifying anomalies.
- **Security assessment** – Understanding vulnerabilities based on scan results.

## Deliverables
- **Final Report** (3–5 pages) detailing findings, methodologies, and recommendations.
- **Labeled screenshots** demonstrating scans and packet analysis.
- **Network topology diagram** with proposed segmentation for security improvements.

## Why This Project Matters
Effective **network reconnaissance and monitoring** are crucial in cybersecurity operations. This project demonstrates **proficiency in network scanning, analysis, and reporting**, key skills for **cybersecurity analysts, SOC teams, and penetration testers**.
