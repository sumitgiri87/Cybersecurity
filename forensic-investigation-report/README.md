### üîç Incident Scenario: The Szechuan Sauce Heist

It all started with a jarring wake-up call. Imagine being ripped from a peaceful sleep as my boss‚Äîwho is nothing short of a mad scientist‚Äîdrags me out of bed. Between his slurred words and unexpected belches, I was told that the FBI had contacted him. His precious, newly-developed Szechuan sauce recipe had somehow surfaced on the dark web. In an instant, I was thrown into action.

Still groggy but quick on my feet, I grabbed my trusty incident response ‚ÄúGo-Bag,‚Äù which included my incident thumb drive and laptop. What followed was a whirlwind of forensic investigation‚Äîtracing the attacker‚Äôs steps, discovering malicious payloads, analyzing artifacts, and ultimately identifying the breach that involved a recipe for the world‚Äôs most coveted sauce.

### üéØ Purpose
This project was an opportunity for me to practice and enhance my digital forensics skills in a hands-on, real-world scenario. The case offered a blend of practical forensics techniques, analysis, and reporting, all while providing a bit of fun with its outrageous storyline.

The investigation had me following a structured process: analyzing servers, dissecting malware, identifying the attack vector, and tracking the intruder‚Äôs activity across the victim network. Through this project, I‚Äôve gained valuable experience in documenting and analyzing cyber incidents with a solid understanding of real-world tactics and techniques.

### üéØ Target Audience
This project is aimed at anyone with an interest in digital forensics, from beginners to seasoned professionals. Whether you're a:

- **Digital Forensics Enthusiast** looking for a challenging, yet fun, scenario to practice on.
- **Aspiring Forensics Investigator** wanting to learn and improve their skills.
- **Educator** who wants a real-world case to use in the classroom or as part of training materials.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Game-isms
As with any training exercise, there are intentional quirks in the data and events. The timeline may appear compressed at times, and some activities may seem a bit outlandish, but these are designed to support the learning experience. Despite the humorous elements, the attack closely mirrors real-world adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.

The goal here was to balance serious forensic work with a fun, interactive case study that would allow me to apply my skills while enjoying the journey. And, let's face it‚Äîtracking down a stolen Szechuan sauce recipe isn‚Äôt something you get to do every day!

### üìù Questions to Answer / Goals
During the investigation, I tackled the following questions (and many more) to piece together the puzzle of the Szechuan sauce heist:

1. **What‚Äôs the Operating System of the Server?**
2. **What‚Äôs the Operating System of the Desktop?**
3. **What was the local time of the Server?**
4. **Was there a breach?**
5. **What was the initial entry vector (how did the attacker get in)?**
6. **Was malware used?** If so, I had to answer questions like:
   - **What process was malicious?**
   - **Identify the IP Address that delivered the payload.**
   - **What IP Address is the malware calling to?**
   - **Where is this malware on disk?**
   - **When did it first appear?**
   - **Did someone move it?**
   - **What were the capabilities of this malware?**
   - **Is this malware easily obtained?**
   - **Was this malware installed with persistence on any machine? If so, when and where?**
7. **What malicious IP Addresses were involved?**
8. **Were any IP Addresses from known adversary infrastructure?**
9. **Are these pieces of adversary infrastructure involved in other attacks around the time of the attack?**
10. **Did the attacker access any other systems?** If so, how and when?
11. **Did the attacker steal or access any data?** If so, when?
12. **What was the network layout of the victim network?**
13. **What architecture changes should be made immediately?**
14. **Did the attacker steal the Szechuan sauce? If so, what time?**
15. **Did the attacker steal or access any other sensitive files? If so, what times?**
16. **Finally, when was the last known contact with the adversary?**


And much more! Each question took me through a thorough forensic analysis, utilizing my skills to track down all the malicious activity that took place.

### ‚ö° Advanced and Bonus Questions
As I delved deeper into the case, I explored even more advanced questions, such as:

- **What CIS Top 20 or SANS Top 20 Controls would have directly prevented this breach?**
- **What major architecture improvement could be made that would have prevented this breach?**
- **Can you identify policy improvements or controls that should be implemented to secure this environment?**
- **Which users have actually logged onto the DC?**
- **Which users have actually logged onto the Desktop machine?**
- **What are the passwords for the users in the domain?**
- **Can you recover the original file about Beth‚Äôs Secrets?** If so, what was the original name and contents?
- **What file was time-stomped?**

### üîç Client Interview

This interview was conducted while retrieving the artifacts from the system using **FTK Imager Lite** and **Redline Collector**.

#### Where were the files in question stored?

The files were located on the **bellllcchhhh File Server** on the **Domain Controller**.

#### What was the Operating System version of this server?

It was whatever **Jerry** installed a few years back. Probably a version of Windows 2012. **Belch.**

#### May I have a network map where the affected systems were located?

Sure. All the systems were loc-bellllch-ated in **10.42 something something**.

#### Were there any other systems or files you are concerned about?

Yeah, certainly. **Morty** is rambling on about something he might have had on there. Also, there was a secret about **Beth** on the server. If you find it, and YOU TELL ANYBODY I WILL KILL YOU! *(Note: The threat here matches a character from a popular cartoon and is not a real threat. Stay calm.)*

### üóì Incident Context

- **Location**: Colorado
- **Date**: September (UTC -6 timezone)

### üß† Potential Questions

#### Why use outdated Windows 2012?

Windows 2012 might be outdated, but its **end of life** isn‚Äôt until 2023. Despite its age, investigations reveal that systems still use Windows 2008r2, even though its **End of Life** date passed in January 2020. Many systems stick with these older versions for longer periods, so it‚Äôs common to encounter them during investigations.

#### Why Windows 10?

**Windows 10** is a useful contrast to Windows 2012 for memory forensics. It uses **compressed memory**, and there will be a difference in **Disk Artifacts** to explore between the two systems, which makes for a richer analysis.

#### I Don‚Äôt Know Forensics! Where do I start?

That‚Äôs exactly the point of this training set! We will teach you how to approach this investigation, set up your environment, analyze artifacts, and then generate a comprehensive report.
