****Incident Response Plan, Playbook, and Policy****


****Project Overview****
This project, part of the **Lighthouse Labs Cybersecurity Bootcamp**, involves developing a comprehensive **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**, supporting playbooks, and related policies aligned with the **NIST 7-step Incident Response framework**. The policies and playbooks aim to guide the organization through various cybersecurity incidents, including **malware outbreaks, data breaches**, and **employee terminations**. The policies focus on effective response, risk mitigation, and compliance, ensuring the organization is well-prepared for potential security incidents.

****Tech Stack****
- **NIST Framework**  
- **Incident Response Team (CSIRT)**  
- **IR Playbook**  
- **IR Policy**
  
****Folder Contents****
- **Incident Response Plan and Policy Set (PDF):** The full Incident Response Plan document detailing the process, team structure, and responsibilities for handling incidents. This outlines high-level policies based on different playbooks, defining objectives, security importance, roles, and consequences of non-compliance.
- **README.md:** This file containing a project summary and important details.
- **Final_Report.pdf:** A comprehensive final report summarizing the project outcomes and the developed policies.

****Methodology****
1. **NIST 7-Step Incident Response Framework:**  
    The policies and playbooks are structured around the **NIST 7-step framework**, which includes:  
    ðŸ”¹ **Preparation** â€“ Ensuring the organization is ready for incident response.  
    ðŸ”¹ **Detection and Analysis** â€“ Identifying and analyzing potential incidents.  
    ðŸ”¹ **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery** â€“ Managing the incident lifecycle.  
    ðŸ”¹ **Lessons Learned** â€“ Reviewing the incident for improvements.  

2. **Policy Outlines:**  
   Each policy is developed to cover key incident types and scenarios. The policies highlight the following:  
    ðŸ”¹ Key objectives of the policy.  
    ðŸ”¹ Assigned responsibilities for incident response.  
    ðŸ”¹ Links to relevant playbooks for detailed execution.  
    ðŸ”¹ Consequences of non-compliance, applicable to both individuals and the organization.

3. **Playbook Integration:**  
    Each policy is supported by a corresponding **playbook**, providing step-by-step guidance to execute the policies effectively during actual incidents.

****Project Objective****
By the end of this project, you will have developed a comprehensive set of policies for various incident response scenarios. Each policy will be actionable through a corresponding playbook, and both will be aligned with the **NIST 7-step Incident Response framework**. These policies are intended to be shared with your team to ensure effective incident management, compliance, and risk mitigation.
