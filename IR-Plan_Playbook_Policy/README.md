# 📘 Incident Response Plan, Playbook, and Policy

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project, completed as part of the **Lighthouse Labs Cybersecurity Bootcamp**, focuses on designing a practical and well-documented **Incident Response strategy** for **[Canadian Tire Corporation](https://corp.canadiantire.ca/)**, specifically addressing **phishing attacks**—one of the most common and damaging threats facing organizations today.

The deliverables include:

- A comprehensive **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**
- A focused **Phishing Incident Playbook**
- Supporting **organizational policies** (e.g. Acceptable Use, Security Awareness)

All materials are aligned with the **NIST 7-step Incident Response Framework**, with a deep focus on the **Preparation** phase—ensuring that when a phishing attempt targets the organization, the response is not reactive, but intentional, quick, and effective.

### 🧠 Realistic & Research-Based

To make this project feel real—not just theoretical—I researched Canadian Tire’s governance and operational structure. That helped shape the **CSIRT (Cybersecurity Incident Response Team)** with roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths that reflect how a large, distributed organization actually works in practice.

---

### 🎯 Why Phishing?

Phishing remains one of the top entry points for threat actors. Whether it's credential harvesting, malware delivery, or business email compromise, phishing can snowball into major incidents if not addressed swiftly and correctly. This IR strategy is designed to help:

- Detect and contain phishing attempts early
- Minimize disruption and data exposure
- Communicate clearly across departments
- Investigate and report incidents thoroughly
- Learn and improve from each occurrence

---

### 🛠️ What This Project Delivers

- ✅ A **real-world applicable IRP** that outlines policies, governance, and lifecycle management
- 🧾 A **step-by-step Phishing Playbook** covering detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned
- 🏛️ Tailored **policies** supporting user awareness, acceptable use, and incident communication
- 📈 Emphasis on **continuous improvement**, compliance, and accountability

This project was more than a bootcamp milestone—it was a chance to build something meaningful and actionable. It reflects my ability to think strategically about cybersecurity, translate frameworks into real-world solutions, and support an organization’s readiness in the face of growing digital threats.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1. 🧩 NIST 7-Step Framework

The project follows the industry-standard **NIST Incident Response Life Cycle**, comprising:

1. **Preparation** – Establishing security policies, training CSIRT, defining assets and threats  
2. **Detection & Analysis** – Logging, monitoring, and identifying anomalous behaviors  
3. **Containment** – Short- and long-term containment strategies  
4. **Eradication** – Identifying root causes and removing malicious artifacts  
5. **Recovery** – Safely restoring systems to normal operation  
6. **Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned)** – Capturing insights to improve future response  
7. **Communication** – Internal and external communication protocols across all phases

### 2. 🛡️ Policy Design

Each policy is crafted to cover a specific scenario and includes:

- 🔹 Clear objectives and scope  
- 🔹 Assigned roles and responsibilities  
- 🔹 Reference to appropriate playbooks  
- 🔹 Consequences for non-compliance  
- 🔹 Links to relevant legal and regulatory requirements (where applicable)

### 3. 🧭 Playbook Integration

Each policy is paired with a **step-by-step playbook** that acts as an operational guide for CSIRT members. These playbooks ensure a **repeatable, efficient, and consistent** response during incidents.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to simulate a real-world security posture by developing:

- ✅ A centralized **Incident Response Plan**  
- ✅ Scenario-specific **Security Policies**  
- ✅ Actionable **Incident Playbooks**  
- ✅ A final analytical **Project Report**

All components are designed to work cohesively to reduce response time, mitigate risk, improve recovery, and create a culture of **cybersecurity awareness and readiness** within the organization.
