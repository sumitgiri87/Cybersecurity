# Incident Response Plan, Playbook, and Policy

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a set of policies that align with the NIST 7-step Incident Response process. You will develop high-level policy outlines for various scenarios, referencing specific playbooks for execution. The policies cover critical cybersecurity activities such as malware outbreaks, data breaches, and employee terminations.

## Folder Contents
- **Incident Response Plan and Policy Set (PDF)**: The full Incident Response Plan document detailing the process, team structure, and responsibilities for handling incidents. Outlines high-level policies based on different playbooks, defining the objectives, security importance, roles, and consequences of non-compliance.
- **README.md**: This file containing a project summary and important details.

## Methodology
1. **NIST 7-Step Incident Response**: The policies and playbooks are based on the NIST 7-step framework, including:
    - **Preparation**: Ensuring the organization is ready for incident response.
    - **Detection and Analysis**: Identifying and analyzing potential incidents.
    - **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**: Managing the incident lifecycle.
    - **Lessons Learned**: Reviewing the incident for improvements.
   
2. **Policy Outlines**: Each policy focuses on key objectives with assigned responsibilities and links to relevant playbooks for detailed instructions. Consequences of non-compliance are clearly outlined for both individuals and the organization.

3. **Playbook Integration**: Policies are supported by corresponding playbooks, offering step-by-step guidance on executing the policies effectively during incidents.

## Project Objective
By the end of this project, you will have created a comprehensive set of policies for incident response scenarios, each aligned with an actionable playbook, and presented them through an educational slideshow.
