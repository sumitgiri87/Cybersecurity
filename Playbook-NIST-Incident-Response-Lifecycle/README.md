# Playbook for Cat & Box Scenario

## Scenario

In this project, we have created a cybersecurity incident response playbook based on the **Cat & Box Scenario**. Box is a small manufacturing company that specializes in making cardboard boxes for cats, while Cat is a consultant from a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) who oversees all of Box’s security needs. 

The scenario involves a potential cybersecurity breach, and the client (Box) relies on external support from Cat to manage the incident. The playbook is designed to ensure that the right individuals are involved, that escalations are properly handled, and that all parties receive the necessary communication.

**Key Points in the Scenario:**
- **Percy F.**, CEO of Box, has contracted an SOC to monitor Box’s network, systems, and data.
- **Miss Misha F.**, the shift and production manager at Box, is responsible for receiving updates during business hours, while **Minka F.** covers after hours.
- **Cat** is responsible for overseeing Box’s cybersecurity and is the point of contact for any detailed incident management.
- The client has no in-house cybersecurity expertise and relies heavily on the third-party MSSP for incident response.

## Context

The purpose of this playbook is to provide a structured response plan for Box, ensuring that the company can effectively handle potential breaches. The playbook is based on the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle** and incorporates guidelines from **CISA** on developing incident response playbooks. This methodology ensures that Box's response to cybersecurity incidents is well-coordinated, timely, and minimizes damage.

### Key Elements in the Playbook:
- **Incident Identification and Triggers**: Focuses on detecting potential threats and understanding when an incident requires escalation.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Outlines the specific responsibilities of individuals involved, including Box's internal team (CEO, production manager, IT support, etc.) and external third-party provider (Cat).
- **Escalation Procedures**: Defines when and how incidents should be escalated to relevant parties, ensuring that urgent issues are promptly addressed.

## Folder Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- **/Final_Report.pdf**: The final project report in PDF format, which includes detailed explanations of the incident response workflow, rationale for decisions, and the key steps taken to develop the playbook.
- **/README.md**: This README file, providing an overview of the project, its scenario, context, methodology, and instructions for use.


## Methodology Followed

The methodology for creating the incident response playbook was based on the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: 
   - Analyzed the Cat & Box scenario in detail to understand the roles, responsibilities, and potential points of escalation.
   - Identified the key individuals involved in the incident response, including internal Box staff and external parties (Cat, the MSSP).

2. **Selecting Incident Types**: 
   - Decided on a specific type of incident (e.g., data breach, ransomware) that could be relevant for the scenario.
   - Used this selection to guide the development of workflows and escalation procedures.

3. **Developing the Playbook Structure**:
   - Created a workflow based on the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle** to guide the incident response process through preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.
   - Defined clear escalation paths and triggered actions based on severity and urgency.

4. **Communication Templates**:
   - Developed both **technical** and **non-technical** communication templates that are tailored to the specific audience (internal teams and external third-party providers).
   - Ensured these templates are professional, clear, and provide the necessary information for each party involved.

5. **Testing the Workflow**: 
   - Walked through the playbook to ensure that it covers all necessary steps for responding to a breach and includes all critical parties.
   - Considered potential edge cases or unusual situations that may require adjustments to the workflow.

6. **Finalizing the Playbook**:
   - Compiled the playbook, templates, and supporting resources into this repository for submission and sharing.
   - Ensured that all documents were well-organized, clearly labeled, and accessible for future use or reference.

## Conclusion

This playbook aims to ensure that Box can respond effectively to any cybersecurity incident, with a clear focus on escalating issues to the right individuals at the right time. By following the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle** and applying industry best practices, the playbook ensures that Box can minimize the impact of incidents and quickly return to normal operations.
