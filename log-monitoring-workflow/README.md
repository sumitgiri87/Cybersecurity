****Log Monitoring Workflow****

****Overview****
This project demonstrates how to apply **Bash and Python scripting** to a **real-world cybersecurity scenario** by automating log monitoring and anomaly detection. The solution establishes a workflow to monitor network traffic for unusual activity, such as **failed login attempts and critical HTTP errors (404, 401, 500)**, ensuring proactive security response and compliance.  

****Scenario****

****Company Profile****  
**Turn a New Leaf** is a **medium-sized non-profit organization** that supports youth in rural communities to find employment. To comply with **government regulations**, members must log in every **Thursday** to update their employment status and job search activities. The organization’s network consists of **both Windows and Linux machines**, with **two Linux-based web servers** handling user authentication and job listing submissions.  

****The Security Request****  
As an **Access Log Analyst** at Turn a New Leaf, your **primary responsibility** is to monitor **server logs for unusual activity** and send alerts if an unusual number of failed logins occur. Additionally, you must **document** and provide **weekly updates via email** to ensure compliance and network security.  

****Key Security Risks****  
🚨 **Failed Login Attempts** – May indicate **brute-force attacks** or **unauthorized access attempts**.  
🚨 **HTTP 401 Errors (Unauthorized)** – Could suggest issues with **user authentication** or **unauthorized access attempts**.  
🚨 **HTTP 404 Errors (Not Found)** – Might indicate **web scraping**, **broken links**, or **malicious scanning**.  
🚨 **HTTP 500 Errors (Server Errors)** – Could reflect **server misconfigurations**, **system crashes**, or **denial-of-service (DoS) attacks**.  

****Project Objectives****  
✅ **Automate log extraction** from Linux web servers.  
✅ **Analyze logs for suspicious activity**, including failed logins and HTTP errors.  
✅ **Send automated alerts** when error thresholds are exceeded.  
✅ **Provide structured reports** for historical analysis and compliance.  


****Workflow Structure****  

****1️⃣ Log Extraction (Bash Script)****  
- A **Bash script** retrieves logs from **Linux access and error logs**.  
- Extracted logs are stored in the `/logs/access_logs/` directory.  

****2️⃣ Log Analysis & Anomaly Detection (Python Scripts)****  
- **Python scripts** process logs to identify:  
  🔹 **Failed login attempts**  
  🔹 **Unauthorized access (HTTP 401 errors)**  
  🔹 **Web scraping attempts (HTTP 404 errors)**  
  🔹 **Server failures (HTTP 500 errors)**  
- If error thresholds are exceeded, an **alert log** is created in `/logs/alert_logs/`.  

****3️⃣ Automated Alerts & Reporting****  
- **Email notifications** are sent when security anomalies are detected.  
- **Weekly reports** summarizing network activity and security risks are generated.  

****Tools & Technologies Used****  
🛠 **Bash** – Extract logs from Linux servers.  
🛠 **Python** – Analyze log data for anomalies.  
🛠 **Cron Jobs** – Automate script execution at scheduled intervals.  
🛠 **Email Alerts** – Notify administrators of unusual activity.  

****Expected Output****  
📌 **Real-time alerts** when suspicious activity is detected.  
📌 **Detailed logs of security events**, including timestamps and affected IP addresses.  
📌 **Comprehensive weekly reports** summarizing system activity and security insights.  

****Key Features****  
✔ **Automated Execution:** Cron jobs ensure continuous monitoring.  
✔ **Historical Data Storage:** Retains records for long-term security analysis.  
✔ **Scalability:** Potential to integrate **machine learning for anomaly detection**.  

****Potential Enhancements****  
🔹 Expanding log analysis to include additional **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**.  
🔹 Enhancing **real-time anomaly detection** with **machine learning models**.  
🔹 Integrating with **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions**.
