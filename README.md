# Cybersecurity Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Projects Repository**, a collection of hands-on projects showcasing my expertise in cybersecurity. This repository includes practical work covering **network security, log monitoring, incident response, risk management, forensics, and threat analysis**. Each project folder contains a detailed **final report**, supporting documentation, and methodologies used.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into different cybersecurity projects. Each folder contains:
- A **project report** detailing the findings, methodologies, and key takeaways.
- Supporting files, scripts, or configurations (where applicable).
- A dedicated **README.md** in each project folder describing the objectives, tools, and outcomes.

### Projects Included

The following projects were completed as part of the **Lighthouse Labs Cybersecurity Bootcamp**:

#### 1. Network Administration
**Objective:** Perform network reconnaissance and documentation.  
- Used **Nmap** and **Wireshark** to analyze devices in a lab environment.
- Created a **network report** detailing discovered devices, configurations, and validation methods.

#### 2. Log Monitoring Workflow
**Objective:** Establish a log monitoring workflow to detect unusual traffic.  
- Designed a **log analysis framework** using command-line tools and scripting.
- Identified expected vs. anomalous behavior and outlined next steps for incident response.

#### 3. Playbook: NIST Incident Response Lifecycle
**Objective:** Develop an **incident response playbook** following NIST and CISA guidelines.  
- Created a structured response for a potential security breach.
- Mapped the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle** to real-world scenarios.

#### 4. Risk Management Case Study
**Objective:** Develop a **Risk Management Plan** using **ISO 27001** standards.  
- Created a **Risk Assessment Table, Risk Treatment Plan, and Statement of Applicability (SoA)**.
- Applied risk assessment methodologies to a real-world case study.

#### 5. Incident Response Plan, Playbook, and Policy
**Objective:** Develop a comprehensive **Incident Response framework**.  
- Created an **Incident Response Policy Set**, outlining policies and their corresponding playbooks.
- Mapped responses to the **NIST 7-step Incident Response process**.
- Developed a **presentation** explaining the impact of compliance vs. non-compliance.

#### 6. Forensics Report and Documentation
**Objective:** Conduct **digital forensic analysis** in an investigative scenario.  
- Worked on **DFIR Madness - The Stolen Szechuan Sauce** case study.
- Analyzed forensic artifacts, documented findings, and created a structured **forensics report**.

#### 7. Capstone Project: Incident Response Report
**Objective:** Apply all learned cybersecurity concepts in a real-world incident scenario.  
- Assessed a **cyber incident** and provided **security recommendations**.
- Created a detailed **Incident Response Report** analyzing a **threat scenario**.
- Prepared a **Demo Day Presentation** summarizing key findings and response strategies.
