# 🛡 Telstra Cybersecurity Job Simulation – Forage Virtual Internship

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the **Telstra Cybersecurity Job Simulation**, a virtual internship completed through [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). It simulates real-world security incidents and response strategies within a **Security Operations Centre (SOC)**. 

The program consists of **four interconnected tasks**, each focusing on different aspects of cybersecurity, including **incident response, network analysis, malware mitigation, and postmortem reporting**.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is divided into **four tasks**, each with its own folder for easy navigation:

### **🔹 Task 1: Responding to a Malware Attack**
- **Objective:** Triage an incoming malware alert, determine affected infrastructure, and notify the appropriate team.
- 📄 **Key Deliverables:**  
  - Firewall logs  
  - Affected Infrastructure List  
  - **Draft_Email.pdf** (Incident Notification Email)  
  - **[Task 1 Folder](https://github.com/sumitgiri87/Cybersecurity/tree/main/Forage-Projects/Telstra-Cybersecurity-Simulation/Task-1_Responding-to-Malware-Attack)**  

---

### **🔹 Task 2: Analysing the Attack**
- **Objective:** Investigate the attack patterns using firewall logs to understand how the malware spreads.
- 📄 **Key Deliverables:**  
  - Firewall logs  
  - Spring4Shell PoC Payload  
  - **Attack_Analysis_Report.pdf**  
  - **Draft_Email_to_Networks_Team.pdf** (Findings Report)  
  - **[Task 2 Folder](https://github.com/sumitgiri87/Cybersecurity/tree/main/Forage-Projects/Telstra-Cybersecurity-Simulation/Task-2_Analysing-the-Attack)**  

---

### **🔹 Task 3: Mitigating the Malware Attack**
- **Objective:** Write a **Python-based firewall rule** to mitigate the malware spread based on identified patterns.
- 📄 **Key Deliverables:**  
  - `firewall_server.py` (Python Firewall Rule)  
  - `test_requests.py` (Testing Script)  
  - **[Task 3 Folder](https://github.com/sumitgiri87/Cybersecurity/tree/main/Forage-Projects/Telstra-Cybersecurity-Simulation/Task-3_Mitigate-the-Malware)**  

---

### **🔹 Task 4: Incident Postmortem**
- **Objective:** Create an **incident postmortem** summarizing the incident, findings, and lessons learned.
- 📄 **Key Deliverables:**  
  - **Postmortem_Report.pdf** (Detailed Incident Report)  
  - **[Task 4 Folder](https://github.com/sumitgiri87/Cybersecurity/tree/main/Forage-Projects/Telstra-Cybersecurity-Simulation/Task-4_Incident-Postmortem)**  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- **Security Operations & Incident Response**: Handling malware threats in a SOC environment.  
- **Network & Threat Analysis**: Investigating malware propagation using network logs.  
- **Security Engineering**: Writing firewall rules for malware mitigation.  
- **Governance & Compliance**: Conducting an **incident postmortem** and documenting findings.
